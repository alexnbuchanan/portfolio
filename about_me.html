              <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                  I’m a naturally curious person. I love to ask questions and learn about the world around me. It was this natural curiosity that led me to my first career in market research. What I find so fascinating about market research is that it allows you to get insights into human psychology and better understand the decisions people make.  Now with five years of experience, I’ve had the opportunity to work at companies such as Sony Pictures and Mattel in which I’ve gained invaluable insights on how to tackle even the most challenging business questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  Despite my love of market research, I always felt like there was something missing from my career. It wasn’t until I worked at Mattel that I gained direct exposure to a dedicated design team. It was through my work with the Mattel design team that I discovered the missing component that I craved for my career: the chance to exercise empathy. I learned that the Mattel design team always utilized empathy when working, the end user was always top of mind. As a toy company, Mattel’s end user are children, so exercising empathy is especially important: it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that what’s easy for an adult is not so easy for a child.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  This was made clear when I was tasked with conducting UX research for a new Mattel toy brick construction app. Using our on-site focus groups, I conducted UX usability tests with kids. It turned out that the app, while clear to adults, was exceedingly difficult for kids to use. In my findings, I noted several pain points and recommendations for improvement. To my surprise, the app was updated according to my recommendations and in subsequent tests the app showed significant improvements. I knew then that I wanted to become a UX designer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  I love UX design because it allows me to exercise my curiosity combined with empathy to help make people’s lives slightly easier. I strive to understand people’s pain points, and remove them, to make complicated things simple. I hope to never lose site of the end user and to make sure that all the products I work on serve to make peoples lives slightly better.
